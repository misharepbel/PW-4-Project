# TeaShop Microservices

## TeaShop Services
- **ApiGateway** - YARP reverse proxy exposing a unified Swagger UI and routing requests to backend services.
- **CatalogService** - CRUD operations for products and categories. Publishes catalog updates via Kafka.
- **CartService** - Stores shopping carts in Redis and validates products from the catalog cache. Emits checkout events.
- **OrderService** - Persists orders in SQL Server and updates order statuses when payments complete.
- **PaymentService** - Processes payments and publishes `OrderPaid` events.
- **UserService** - Handles user registration, login, password reset and issues JWT tokens. Enforces roles.
- **NotificationService** - Sends emails for registration, password reset and payment receipts.

## Tech Stack
- **.NET 8 / ASP.NET Core** – microservice APIs.
- **Entity Framework Core & SQL Server** – relational storage for orders, users and catalog.
- **Redis** – cart storage.
- **Apache Kafka** – asynchronous communication between services.
- **MediatR** – simplifies request/response handling inside services.
- **YARP Reverse Proxy** – gateway routing and aggregated Swagger docs.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** – containerised deployment.

## Running with Docker
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in connection strings, Kafka topics and JWT keys.
2. Build and launch all services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Open `http://localhost:8080/swagger` to access the gateway and select a service cluster.

Stop the stack with `docker-compose down`.

## Running Tests
From the repository root run:
```bash
dotnet test CatalogService/CatalogService.UnitTests/CatalogService.UnitTests.csproj
dotnet test CatalogService/CatalogService.IntegrationTests/CatalogService.IntegrationTests.csproj
```
The commands restore packages and build the test projects automatically.

## Requirements and Implementation
- [x] **Grade 3.0** – Customer details retrieval, Product CRUD, Category CRUD, Cart CRUD, SINGLE SERVICE - Initially provided by a monolithic app combining User, Catalog and Cart features.
- [x] **Grade 3.5** – All of Grade 3.0 plus unit and integration tests - CatalogService contains dedicated test suites.
- [x] **Grade 4.0** – All of Grade 3.5 plus JWT with registration, login, password reset, account editing, user roles, cart processing and email receipts - Implemented across UserService, CartService, OrderService and NotificationService.
- [x] **Grade 4.5** – All of Grade 4.0 deployed as microservices (at least three services) - ApiGateway and six domain services communicate via Kafka.
- [x] **Grade 5.0** – All of Grade 4.5 packaged as Docker images and using technologies like Kafka or MediatR - Docker Compose builds the stack and services use Kafka and MediatR

## API Endpoints
Below is a short description of the available endpoints in each service and how they are secured.

### CatalogService

- `POST /reset-password` - Reset password with token

### PaymentService
#### Admin and user
- `POST /simulate-payment` - Simulate payment

#### Unauthorized
- `GET /` - Health check

### ApiGateway
The gateway exposes `GET /swagger` for API discovery and forwards all other requests to backend services.

## Detailed Event Flow
1. User registration → `UserRegisteredEvent` → NotificationService sends a welcome email.
2. Password reset → `PasswordResetEvent` → NotificationService delivers a reset link.
3. Catalog modifications → `ProductCacheEvent` → CartService refreshes its product cache.
4. Cart checkout → `CartCheckedOutEvent` → OrderService creates an order and CartService clears the cart.
5. Payment → `OrderPaidEvent` → OrderService marks the order paid and NotificationService emails the receipt.
